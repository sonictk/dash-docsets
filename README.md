# Dash docsets for parallel computing

Provides docsets for the [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) documentation browser for GNU Fortran compiler, GNU OpenMP and MPI-2 standard libraries.

Software developers who wish to develop new parallel applications or wish to add parallel capabilities to existing software would benefit from using this documentation in Dash.

* [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/)
* [OpenMP](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/)
* [MPI](hhttp://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-2.0/mpi-20-html/mpi2-report.html)

All docsets are set to use the Python language family and are added under the `python:` keyword by default. The scripts used to build the docsets are included.

## Installation in Dash

Simple download the raw files and open them with Dash.
